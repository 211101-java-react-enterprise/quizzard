 * Interfaces
 *
 *      - acts as a "contract" for implementing classes (layman's terms: any concrete class that implements
 *        this interface will be required to provide logic for the declared methods of this interface)
 *
*       - do not have constructors (and therefore cannot be instantiated)
 *
 *       - the interface declaration is implicitly abstract
 *
 *       - all method stubs declared within an interface are implicitly abstract and public
 *
 *       - any fields included in an interface are implicitly: public, static, and final
 *
 *       - can contain concrete (non-abstract) methods:
 *          + static methods
 *          + default methods (introduced in Java 8)
