/* Interfaces

    - acts as a "contract" for implementing classes (layman's terms: any concrete class that implements
        this interface will be required to provide logic for the declared methods of this interface)

    - do not have constructors (and therefore cannot be instantiated)

    - the interface declaration is implicitly abstract

    - all method stubs declared within an interface are implicitly abstract and public

    - can contain concrete (non-abstract) methods:
        + static methods
        + default methods (introduced in Java 8) */
